# CS100.1x Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark

These are the labs I did as part of the CS100.1x MOOC.
I started with prior python experience but no apache spark knowledge.

## MOOC Details

__Date:__ June 2015
__School__ University of California, Berkeley

## Description 
The questions are written directly into each file, with skeleton code underneath which we were supposed to complete.  The original assignment templates can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/spark-mooc/mooc-setup/).  

## Environment
The code was all written in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) editor.  
We were asked to set it up with:
 * [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
 * [This vagrant file](https://github.com/spark-mooc/mooc-setup/blob/master/Vagrantfile).
